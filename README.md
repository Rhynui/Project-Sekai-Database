# Project Sekai Database

A database that stores scores from Project SEKAI, a rhythm game.

Users can add, edit, and delete entries in the database. They can also filter existing data based on the scores' difficulties, accuracies, and amounts of combo breaks.

## Run

Run `graphics.py` or `text.py` to launch the graphics or text-based version of the program, respectively.
